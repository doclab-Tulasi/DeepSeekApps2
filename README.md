Zero Trust Scanner for security 
The user wants me to create a Zero-Trust scanning application using pure HTML. Zero Trust is a security model that requires strict identity verification and access controls. But how do I translate that into a web app with just HTML? Well, pure HTML is static, so I need to rely on client-side JavaScript for any functionality. But since the user specified "pure HTML," maybe they meant no server-side code?

First, I should outline the features a Zero Trust scanner might have, such as file scanning for malware, password strength checks, and link validation. Since it's client-side, I can't do actual malware scanning, but I can simulate it. For passwords, I can check their strength using JavaScript. Link validation can check if URLs are suspicious.

I'll structure the app with sections for each feature: file scan, password check, link check. Use HTML forms and inputs. Styling with CSS to make it look clean. For the file scan, use HTML5 File API to read files and simulate checks. For passwords, use regex to test strength. Links can be checked against known malicious domains, maybe a client-side list.

Wait, but Zero Trust involves continuous verification. How can we handle that? Maybe we should add a periodic recheck feature. For example, we could use JavaScript timers to re-validate inputs every few seconds. We could also display results dynamically.

Security considerations: Since it's client-side, no data is sent to a server, which is good for privacy. However, note the limitations, like simulated malware checks. You need to inform the user that this is a demo.

Implementing the HTML structure: Use a container div, sections for each scanner. Input fields with event listeners. Results areas that update based on checks. CSS for layout and colors to indicate status (safe, warning, danger).

Testing each part: For files, check the name and size, maybe extension. For passwords, length, complexity. For links, check if the domain is in a list of risky ones. Use tooltips or text to show results.

Disclaimer: this is a demo only. 

Below is a JavaScript implementation for handling file input, password input, and link input. It uses setTimeout to simulate asynchronous checks and updates the UI accordingly. Note that this solution does not perform real malware detection or actual URL validation; it's a simple demonstration. For a real Zero Trust app, proper server-side processing and security measures are needed.
